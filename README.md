Pokémon Gen 6 Learnsets Data
============================

Traditionally, Pokémon learnsets are obtained by ripping data from cartridges.
Unfortunately, this isn't possible with the 3DS currently, which has led to
the current situation of massive confusion.

These files are PS's attempt to make learnset data collection/organization
easy for non-programmers, by serializing data into a human-readable format
(the `learnsets-g6` folder).

Also in this repository: a collection of scripts for importing and exporting
data from a variety of other formats into our human-readable format.
