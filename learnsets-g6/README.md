============================

This should be in the the following format:

	[How to get the move] - [Move name]

Specifically, it should be in this order (and how to get the move *must* be
written one of these ways):

	Start - [Start move]
	L? - [Level-up move of unknown level]
	L5 - [Level 5 level-up move]
	TM - [TM or HM move]
	Egg - [Egg move]
	Event - [Event move]

Remember: You need a space both before and after the `-`.
